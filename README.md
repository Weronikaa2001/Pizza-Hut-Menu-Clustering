# Pizza Hut Menu Clustering - R project

This project explores a clustering analysis of the Pizza Hut menu, utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques to group menu items based on their attributes. The goal is to identify patterns and similarities between different dishes, offering valuable insights for improving menu design and marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about various Pizza Hut menu items, including their categories, ingredients, and nutritional information. Through clustering techniques, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and silhouette analysis, we attempt to group similar menu items together, revealing hidden patterns and trends that may not be immediately obvious.

## Key Insights
* Identification of clusters of similar items (e.g., pizza types, sides, beverages).
* Understanding which menu items share common ingredients or nutritional profiles.
* Exploration of how clustering can inform strategic decisions in menu optimization, pricing, and customer preferences.

## Techniques Used
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
* Clustering Algorithms: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering.
* Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.
* Data Visualization: Visualizing the clustering results using plots and dendrograms.
